The experiments run on Python version 2.7.11 because at this time, Psychopy2 only supported python2
and this was the IDE we needed to run our code in for our research. The instructions of each experiment
is presented when the experiment is run.

You can run this experiment easily by opening the folder Boredom and then running any of the python files
within that are one of the three experiments. The data is stored in folders of the same name as the experiment 
with the extension DATA.

In this set of experiments, we test a participants tolerance to boredom to draw conclusions on what makes people
bored. Each experiment gets more boring in the order presented below. 

Keyboard Task - Participants click on their keyboard to make letters on the screen disappear. We add a delay between
each trial to make the task a little more annoying.

MouseButtonTask - This is similar to the task above except participants use their mouse to click a keyboard on screen.
This keyboard is in the standard QWERTY keyboard format.

RandomMouseButtonTask - Almost identical to the MouseButtonTask except that the keyboard on screen is randomized between
each trial making the task very annoying.
